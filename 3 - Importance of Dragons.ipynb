    "In 2019, [Tim Sevenhuysen's Dragon Analysis](https://oracleselixir.com/blog/post/10689/early-game-rating-2-0) shows the importance of killing a dragon in the early stage of the game (~15 minutes). His analysis shows a difference of 1 dragon results in a 40-60% Win Rate. In the next two sections, I want to analyze, based off of the LCK data, how much of an impact taking the first dragon in the game has on its outcome, as well as do a reverification of the dragon differential on the 2020 LCK dataset.\n",

    "The value of dragons differ greatly, and I think that deserves it's own analysis on specific impact per time range. I don't have that metadata, so I am utilizing every dragon into one category.\n",
