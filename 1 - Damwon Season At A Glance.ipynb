    "# 1- DAMWON Season At a Glance\n",
    "\n",
    "For DAMWON Gaming, their shift in a middling spring split to incredibly dominant summer is a factor in my wanting to take a more detailed look at possible factors for this shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "After data collection and handling, the first true analytical step of the project is to see an overall snapshot of who played for Damwon during each split, how many games they played, position, and KDA, which is a metric to show a ratio of Kills + Assists / Deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a glance, here are the records from Damwon's 2020 Run Key: Match Count (Game Count): \n",
    "- LCK Spring 2020 Regular Season: 9-9 (22-21) \n",
    "- 5th/10 Spr 2020 Playoffs: 1-1 (4-4)\n",
    "- 1st Summer 2020 Regular Season: 16-2 (34-5) \n",
    "- 1st Summer 2020 Playoffs: 1-0 (3-0) \n",
    "- 1st Worlds 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Data\n",
    "For this project, I used the data provided by Oracle's Elixr, which had the data for each LoL esports entry. In the LCK, there are two regular seasons + playoffs, or splits, per year. At the time I started the project, I found the data for Damwon for Spring and Summer 2020 split (regular season and playoffs). I didn't include their domestic cup (KeSPA) or mid-season cup runs. Since the splits have importance on qualification for larger events (Mid-Season Invitational and Worlds), I felt the analysis should be limited to these two splits. The data was in CSV format, so I imported the data into MySQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a vast amount of variables in the original database, so I will have a key for the ones I used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to query the data in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` SELECT player, position, team, count(player) as appearances, sum(kills) as kills, sum(assists) as assists, sum(deaths) as deaths, (sum(kills)+sum(assists))/(sum(deaths)) as kda  \n",
    "FROM league.2020leagueinfo  \n",
    "WHERE league = \"LCK\" AND split = \"Summer\" and position = \"sup\"  \n",
    "GROUP BY player; ```\n",
